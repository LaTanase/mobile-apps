Laborator made by Laurentiu Tanase.

1. I've ran into some issues while doing the lab with the buttons defined in the fragments and that they we're null when trying to call them.
2. The tutorial from point 2 is obsolete, newer android applications use androidx.fragment.app.Fragment instead of android.app.Fragment that is present in the tutorial.
3. I've understand why we use fragments and that them could be reused in another views but i couldn't make this example works.
4. Tried to do a switch button that changes the fragment used to Listen or Speak and this part works. The only one that doesn't work is that the buttons are not assigned any onClickListeners.
5. Please review and help with some indications.
