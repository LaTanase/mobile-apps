This lab was made by Laurentiu Tanase and Maria Popescu.

Maria was in charge with the documentation with the differences between SQL/NOSql and Firebase/SQLite.
She did his part in time, but the late was caused by me, Laurentiu. I've had some issues with the work and didn't have the time to do the lab on time.

Regarding this lab, we learn about databases in Android, how to work with them, insert items, delete items, update items.
The second exercise told to look at the tutorial and i've decided to do it for the lab.

It was pretty good explained but i've choose to work with the new libraries instead the ones used in the tutorial. (Androidx package instead of android.support.v7)
